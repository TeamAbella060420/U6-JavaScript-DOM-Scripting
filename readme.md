# JavaScript DOM Scripting

1. Tour the Application - It's party time! You're planning a party, and you've sent invitations out. Now as the RSVP's come in, you need a way to keep track of who's coming. Let's look at the app we'll be building to manage that for us.
2. Registering Names - The first feature we'll work on is name registration. We'll harness the default browser behavior for forms to get two handlers for the price of one, using the submit event.
3. RSVP Checkbox - Let's allow users to mark off when guests respond that they intend to come to the party.
4. Removing Names - What if users make a mistake and want to remove a name? Let's add a button to each list item to delete it. We'll also move to a delegated click handler, to allow us to set one handler for all buttons.
